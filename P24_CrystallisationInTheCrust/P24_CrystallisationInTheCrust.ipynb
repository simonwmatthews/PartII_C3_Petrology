    "# Part II C3 Petrology - Practical 24: Crystallisation in the Icelandic Crust\n",

    "In this practical you will apply some commonly used geobarometers to understanding how crystallisation happens in the Icelandic crust, and how that might be transferrable to understanding mid-ocean ridges in general.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Crustal Accretion at Mid-Ocean Ridges\n",
    "\n",
    "The mode of crustal accretion at mid-ocean ridges can be constrained with geophysical and geochemical observations at active ridges and geological work at ophiolites. Two end-member models of crustal accretion are the gabbro-glacier models and the stacked-sills models. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the __gabbro glacier__, melt is supplied directly from the mantle to a shallow magma chamber. Cooling of melt and crystallisation occurs in this magma chamber. The solid cumulate gabbros of the lower crust are then fed downwards by solid flow to generate the full thickness of oceanic crust. Importantly, in this model, all crystallisation takes place in the shallow melt lens and above. \n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, the __stacked-sills model__, favoured by workers such as Peter [Kelemen](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X9600235X), involves crystallisation throughout the lower axial crust. In this model, mantle melts stall close to, or beneath, the Moho in small melt sills. Cooling and crystallisation occurs in these sills. Melt is then extracted from the sills, and may pond and crystallise in a series of sills in the lower crust. Therefore, in contrast to the gabbro-glacier model, the stacked-sills model involves crystallisation at a range of depths in the lower crust.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Arguments over oceanic crustal accretion mechanisms tend to focus on fast-spreading ridges. However, studying the Icelandic rift zones has made an important contribution to this subject. Geophysical studies have identified a shallow melt lens at 3-5 km depth under the Krafla caldera. This melt lens apparently sits above a predominantly solid lower crust that extends to ~20 km depth at Krafla. The arrangement of a shallow melt lens over a seismically fast lower crust inspired the development of a gabbro-glacier model of crustal accretion for Iceland [(Menke and Sparks, 1995)](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/95GL01597/full). In this practical, we will use the major element composition and petrography of Icelandic basalts to test this gabbro-glacier model. \n",

    "## 2. Iceland: The Krafla and Theistareykir volcanic systems ##\n",
    "\n",
    "The northern part of the Northern Rift Zone is a good location to examine crustal accretion mechanisms because it has been the focus of geophysical, geological and petrological observations since the 1975-84 Krafla fissure eruptions. Use Google Earth to take a look at the region and refer to geological maps to get a feeling for the area.\n",

    "You have just extracted information about the composition of the cumulate material by assuming that the variation in the compositions of lava samples can be matched by fractional crystallisation of the minerals observed as macrocryst phases in the samples themselves. This seems like a reasonable approach. Another approach involves specifying a primary melt composition and the physical conditions of crystallisation and using parameterisations of experimental data and thermodynamic logic to predict the sequence of crystallisation, the mineral proportions, mineral compositions and the liquid line of descent. Programs such as [PETROLOG](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2011GC003516) by Leonid Danyushevsky and [MELTS](http://melts.ofm-research.org/) by Ghiorso and Sack provide useful tools for exploring crystallisation paths. If you have the time and the inclination you could try to run an LLD model and see if you can match the Icelandic data. There are multiple ways of running MELTS, including via a python interface using cloud based Jupyter Notebooks on the [ENKI server](http://enki-portal.org). The ENKI server is free to use, but requires registering.\n"

    "Clinopyroxene phenocrysts are rare in MORB. This observation, combined with the fact that many MORB fractionation trends are gabbro-controlled (i.e. ~40% modal clinopyroxene) has been termed the âpyroxene paradoxâ. However, it is not paradoxical if one understands the effect of pressure on the pyroxene stability field.\n",

    "Fortunately, some Icelandic basalt flows contain clinopyroxene phenocrysts. More primitive flows contain pyroxenes with a distinctive âHeinekenâ green colour â chromian diopsides. More evolved flows, such as the Krafla fissure eruptions, contain black/purple Ti-bearing augites. The composition of pyroxene phenocrysts is influenced both by the composition of the melt that they grow from and by the physical conditions (i.e. P, T) at the time of growth. [Neave & Putirka](https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/ammin/article-lookup/102/4/777) have recently parameterised the results of hundreds of experiments that involve cpx-basalt equilibrium, and have produced a thermobarometer for Iceland compositions, shown below:\n",
