    "In earlier lectures and practicals you have examined some of the methods that have been used to estimate mantle potential temperatures, $T_p$, from observations at mid-ocean ridges. In particular we have investigated how correlated variations in oceanic crustal thickness, ridge axial depth and MORB chemistry can be understood within the framework of a simple model of adiabatic decompression melting. The correlated variations are thought to reflect variations in $T_p$ of about 200$^{\\circ}$C around the global MOR system.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is useful to find independent observations that can be used to constrain $T_p$ that rely on different sets of assumptions to those involved in the modelling described above. A very popular technique is to use petrological observations to estimate the temperatures of primary mantle melts, and then correcting for heat conversion during melting to arrive at $T_p$. The first step generally involves using the temperature dependence of mineral-mineral or mineral-melt equilibria combined with measured mineral and rock compositions. One such petrological thermometer is based on the temperature-dependence of aluminium partitioning in olivine (the olivine-spinel Al-exchange thermometer).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this practical you will use this thermometer to estimate the temperature at which primitive olivine crystals form in Iceland and MORB. You will then set up a simple model to relate crystallisation temperatures to mantle $T_p$."

    "## 1. How does Al-in-olivine thermometry work?\n",
    "\n",
    "As you might expect from thermodynamic arguments, the ability of olivine to tolerate Al within its structure increases with increasing temperature. In effect, the partition coefficient of Al between olivine and melt rises at higher temperatures. It is also well known that the partitioning of Fe and Mg between olivine and melt is strongly temperature dependent. So, if we can find pairs of olivine and liquid that we know were in chemical equilibrium at igneous conditions, we might be able to use them as thermometers - much like the approach that you may familiar with from metamorphic petrology.\n",

    "\n",
    "In order to circumvent these problems, scientists such as [Coogan et al.](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0009254114000278) have investigated the partitioning of Al between olivine and spinel. The hope here is that spinel inclusions trapped inside olivine crystallisting from primitive melts can retain their high temperature equilibrium compositions because Al diffusion is very slow in olivine. Chromian spinel is a common liquidus phase in primitive basaltic melts, so is often found in association with highly forsteritic olivines that grow at high temperatures in basaltic systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Coogan et al. suggested that the dominiant mode of Al exchange between olivine and spinel involved the following reaction:\n",
    "$$\\require{mhchem}$$\n",
    "$$\\ce{MgAl2O4 (spinel) -> (MgAl) AlO4 (olivine)}$$\n",

    "\n",
    "$$T = \\frac{10000}{(A +B \\times Cr{\\#} + C \\times \\ln{k_d})}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $T$ is the equilibrium temperature in Kelvin, the 'chrome-number' of the spinel is given by: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ Cr{\\#} = \\frac{X_{Cr}}{X_{Cr}+X_{Al}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "with $X_{Cr}$ and $X_{Al}$ being the mole fractions of Cr and Al in the spinel. The partition coefficient of Al between the olivine and spinel is given by \n",

    "This exercise is a based on work that came out of my Part III project several years ago... To read a full description of the method, the uncertainties, and the effect of lithological heterogeneity you can read [Matthews et al., 2016](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/wol1/doi/10.1002/2016GC006497/full). To see how we applied the same methods to OIB (and some of the additional uncertainties that introduces) you can read [Matthews et al., 2021](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2020GC009157). Also, take a look at the papers from, for example, [Dalton et al., 2014](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/344/6179/80.full) for an understanding of how such petrological constraints on mantle $T_p$ might be related to geophysical observables.
