    "Iceland has experienced a series of glaciations over the last 3 million years. During the most recent glacial period, which ended about 12 kyr ago, an ice sheet up to 2 km in thickness covered most of the island. The presence of this ice sheet had an important influence on volcanic activity in Iceland. \n",
    "\n",
    "This effect causes clear differences in volcanic morphology between glacial and post-glacial eruptions. The relative ages of individual eruptions can therefore be estimated by inspection of volcanic morphology. Another method which has been used by Icelandic geologists to provide a stratigraphy for postglacial eruptions is known as tephrochronology. This technique relies upon the identification of well characterised tephra layers within the sequence of lava flows. Tephra is material consisting of fragments of volcanic rock of any size expelled from a volcano, but tephrochronology usually relies on ash. When such layers can be confidently associated with organic material of the same age, then it is possible to assign absolute bounds on the ages of eruptions by using <sup>14</sup>C dating. \n",

However, in the calculations above, it was assumed that the decompression resulting from unloading of the ice would result in uniform decompression in the melting region. Detailed models of the effects of unloading on decompression rates within a visco-elastic medium were first performed by [Jull & McKenzie](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/96JB01308/abstract) (JM96) and results are shown in the figures available in the lab, or the powerpoint presentation on Moodle. Updated calculations and a [fancy video](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/downloadSupplement?doi=10.1029%2F2019GC008222&file=ggge21894-sup-0002-2019GC008222-Movie_SI-S01.mp4) are available in [Eksinchol et al., 2019](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2019GC008222)."
